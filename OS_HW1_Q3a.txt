Pipes have at least three advantages over temporary files in this situation. First, pipes automatically
clean themselves up; with the file redirection, a shell would have to be careful to remove /tmp/xyz
when done. Second, pipes can pass arbitrarily long streams of data, while file redirection requires
enough free space on disk to store all the data. Third, pipes allow for parallel execution of pipeline
stages, while the file approach requires the first program to finish before the second starts.
